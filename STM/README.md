Example of a simulation of a STM image of a benzene molecule.

This is roughly based on the official SIESTA tutorial [Simulation of STM images](https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/en/latest/tutorials/applications/stm-images/index.html) but using python (sisl library).

We provide:
- Model fdf file for STM and a model jupyter notebook for STM analysis
- Solved example for a benzene molecule
