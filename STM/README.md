Example of a simulation of a STM image of a benzene molecule.

This is roughly based on the official SIESTA tutorial [Simulation of STM images](https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/en/latest/tutorials/applications/stm-images/index.html) but using python (sisl library) and VMD.

We provide:
- Model of a simple fdf file for SIESTA to obtain the Hamiltonian, needed for the STM calculation
- Template of a jupyter notebook for STM analysis using SISL,
- Template of a jupyter notebook to export to cube files for visualization with external software such as VMD. 
- Data for a fully solved example for a benzene molecule
