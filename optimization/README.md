# Example files for geometry optimization
Example fdf files suitable for:
- geometry optimization of an isolated molecule
- geometry optimization of a crystal (variable cell).
  
More information about geometry optimization in SIESTA from the official tutorials is available [here](https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/en/latest/tutorials/basic/structure-optimization/).

A good presentation about the concepts involved can be found [here](https://siesta.icmab.es/siesta/events/SIESTA_School-2024/Geometry_Optimization+MD-2024.pdf).
