## Geometry optimization
# fdf Scripts
Example fdf files suitable for geometry optimization (energy minimization) of molecules and crystals:
- geometry optimization of an isolated molecule: optimization.fdf
- structure relaxation (variable cell) of a crystal: relaxation.fdf

In both cases the script expects a structure.fdf file with the coordinates.

More information about geometry optimization in SIESTA from the official tutorials is available [here](https://docs.siesta-project.org/projects/siesta/en/latest/tutorials/basic/structure-optimization/).



A good presentation about the concepts involved can be found [here](https://siesta.icmab.es/siesta/events/SIESTA_School-2024/Geometry_Optimization+MD-2024.pdf).
