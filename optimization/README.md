# Geometry optimization
## fdf Scripts
Example fdf files suitable for geometry optimization (energy minimization) of molecules and crystals:
- geometry optimization of an isolated molecule: optimization.fdf
- structure relaxation (variable cell) of a crystal: relaxation.fdf

In both cases the script expects a structure.fdf file with the coordinates.

## Pseudopotentials
Pseudopotentials for SIESTA v5 in psml format can be downloaded from [pseudo-dojo](https://www.pseudo-dojo.org/)

## Further Information
